# Impact & Success Metrics

## Theory of Change

Our approach to creating meaningful change follows three interconnected pathways:

### 1. Experience Transforms Expectations
When people experience spatial collaboration that feels both more human and more effective, their expectations for all digital tools permanently shift. Just as social media changed our ability to stay connected anywhere, DSX aims to deepen our relationships through how we choose to connect.

### 2. Create New Norms in Communities
By building spaces that prioritize connection alongside creation, we enable communities to develop healthier collaborative practices. These new norms gradually spread beyond our network, influencing broader digital culture.

### 3. Economic Models That Enable Sustainability
Traditional productivity tools are funded by business models that incentivize engagement over wellbeing. DSX explores alternative economic approaches that align financial sustainability with human flourishing, proving that better models are possible.

## Problems We're Solving

DSX evolves several fragmented Web 2.0 platforms into more integrated, contextual experiences:

- **Our Solution**: Spatial environments where thoughts visibly connect to related concepts
- **Impact**: Network of meaning rather than collection of fragments

### Project Management
- **Current Problem**: Hide decision context and reasoning
- **Our Solution**: Spaces that preserve the journey and decision-making process
- **Impact**: Better understanding of how and why choices were made

### Relationship Management
