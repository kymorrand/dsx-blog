# Project Documentation

This documentation is part of our "building in public" initiative for the DSX Blog project. Here you'll find comprehensive documentation about our development process, design decisions, and technical architecture.

## Documentation Structure

- `/design`: UX decisions and design principles
- `/technical`: Technical specifications and architecture
- `/blog`: Development updates and progress
- `/guides`: Usage and development guides

## Contributing

All documentation is written in MDX format, allowing for interactive components and live code examples. This enables us to maintain our documentation alongside our code and present it as part of our public website.

## Navigation

Each section has its own README.md providing an overview of that section's contents. Use the navigation menu to explore different sections of the documentation.
