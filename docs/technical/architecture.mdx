# Technical Architecture

## Dataspace Architecture

The core component of our network is built on [dataspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataspace). Unlike centralized cloud architectures which consolidate user information in corporate servers, our dataspace architecture focuses on orchestrating decentralized networks of information and communication.

### Key Characteristics

- **User-Controlled Environments**: Dataspaces function as persistent, addressable "locations" within the Digital Sunshine network
- **Ownership & Sharing**: Can be owned, shared, and connected by users through composability practices
- **Identity Integration**: Seamless integration with Canvas identity and Buddies
- **Specialized Management**: Buddies can help manage, organize, and cultivate each dataspace according to its purpose

## Dataspace Types

Following our Live-Work-Learn-Play neighborhood model:

### Homebases (Live)
- Personal gardens for individual ideas and content
- Local-first spaces protecting data sovereignty
- Primary development environment for Buddies
- Control center for Canvas identity and personal connections

### Guilds (Work)
- Collaborative workshops for team creation
- Professional-grade tools with organic interfaces
- Support for specialized Buddy interaction
- Privacy-respecting knowledge sharing

### Libraries (Learn)
- Knowledge forests maintained with public organizations
- Spatial repositories for collective wisdom
- Alternative to algorithmic recommendation systems
- Curated information connections across spaces

### Playgrounds (Play)
- Experimental sandboxes for testing ideas
- Game-like environments for creative interaction
- Support for playful Buddy personas
- Maintenance of specialized knowledge in casual contexts

## Technical Components

### Canvas System
- Digital portfolio management
- Activity tracking across communities
- Privacy and moderation controls
- Identity persistence across dataspaces

### Buddy Framework
- Specialized avatar development
- Learning from user interactions
- Customizable algorithms
- Privacy-respecting knowledge sharing
- Cross-dataspace operation

### Easel Toolkit
- Integrated media environment
- Spatial arrangement engine
- Contextual tool deployment
- Buddy integration interface
- Recipe template system

### Vibes Engine
- User-controlled content curation
- Context-aware pattern matching
- Transparency layer
- Preference management system

## Future-Ready Architecture

Our spatial foundation prepares us for:
- VR integration
- Mixed reality environments
- Seamless physical-digital blending
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Privacy & Security

- Local-first data architecture
- User-controlled sharing mechanisms
- Transparent data handling
- Privacy-preserving Buddy development
- Secure dataspace isolation

## Development Principles

1. **Decentralization First**
   - Prioritize user control
   - Minimize central dependencies
   - Enable local-first operations

2. **Privacy by Design**
   - Built-in data protection
   - User-controlled sharing
   - Transparent operations

3. **Extensibility**
   - Modular components
   - Clear interfaces
   - Future-ready design

4. **Performance**
   - Efficient data handling
   - Responsive interfaces
   - Scalable architecture
