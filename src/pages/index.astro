			<h1>🌟 Welcome to The Builders Log</h1>
			<p>
				This is the daily development journal documenting the journey of building <strong>The Digital Sunshine Exchange (DSX)</strong> through Lab3. Each day, we'll share insights, challenges, and progress as we build in public.
			</p>
			<h2>What is DSX?</h2>
			<p>
				The Digital Sunshine Exchange is a project focused on reimagining digital spaces for meaningful connection. Through transparent development and open collaboration, we're documenting every step of the journey.
			</p>
			<h2>How It Works</h2>
			<p>Our development process is powered by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>🤖 <strong>AI Buddy System</strong> - An intelligent interviewer that helps capture daily progress</li>
				<li>📝 <strong>Daily Logs</strong> - Detailed development updates in MDX format</li>
				<li>🔄 <strong>Multi-Platform Publishing</strong> - Automated sharing across BlueSky, Twitter, and LinkedIn</li>
				<li>🌐 <strong>Open Source</strong> - Complete transparency in our development process</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>Current Status</h2>
			<p>
				We're just getting started! The first post documenting Day One is live, where we share our initial setup and the vision for this development log. Check out the <a href="/blog">blog section</a> to follow our progress.
			</p>
			<p>
				Built with <a href="https://astro.build/">Astro</a> and developed in <a href="https://windsurf.io">Windsurf</a>, emphasizing data interoperability and open-source principles.
