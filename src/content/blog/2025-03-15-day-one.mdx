# Day One: Launching The Builders Log

Today marks the beginning of a new journey - documenting the development of The Digital Sunshine Exchange (DSX) through a daily builders log. This isn't just another development blog; it's an experiment in AI-assisted documentation and transparent building in public.

## Today's Focus

The primary goal today was to establish a foundation for sharing this journey. I wanted to create a "Builders Log" system that combines personal blogging with AI-assisted content creation and seamless social sharing. The key was finding a balance between sophisticated tools and maintaining simplicity in the process.

## Key Decisions & Progress

I've settled on a tech stack that emphasizes openness and flexibility:
- **Web Framework**: Astro for its performance and markdown-first approach
- **Hosting**: Vercel for reliable deployment
- **Version Control**: GitHub for open development
- **Development Environment**: Windsurf, an AI-enhanced IDE recommended by Alfonso

The most interesting aspect is the implementation of an AI Buddy system that helps document the development process through conversational interviews, making the documentation process feel more natural and engaging.

## Challenges & Approach

The main challenge was avoiding the common trap of over-engineering from day one. Instead of getting caught up in specific tools or frameworks, I've focused on:
1. Keeping the process simple and iterative
2. Prioritizing open-source solutions
3. Ensuring data interoperability through markdown-based content
4. Creating a foundation that can evolve with the project

## What's Next

Today's focus has been on testing the user experience of the Buddy system - having a conversation with an AI assistant that can transform our discussion into structured blog posts and share them across social platforms. This initial test will help shape how we continue to document and share the DSX development journey.
